A Unity game project that I have worked on from scratch during internship. It will (hopefully) have updates and become an actual game that is playable.

The game was developed by just 2 computer science students which are my friend and I. It do not have good models, storyline or game mechanics (oof) but I will try to figure it out and make the game _great again_.
