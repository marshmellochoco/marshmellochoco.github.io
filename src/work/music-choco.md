A full-stack music player web application which is my first attempt on full stack application. My initial idea is to make a music player that plays my own songs. Turns out now it is a Spotify clone now (bruh).

music-choco provides features such as

-   playing the songs (duh)
-   song queue
-   browse songs my songs (wow)
-   upload your own songs
-   praise my work
-   and... let me think...

by the way here are some screenshots.
jk there are no screenshots.
